Dynamics of Non-Linear robotic system Homework 5

Trajectory Planning between 2 points for RRR elbow type robot arm with constraints on

1- minimum trajectory time 

2- angular velocity and angular acceleration

3- linear velocity and linear acceleration


For using you need to download:
- Hw_4 is the main code in livescript which contains all the codes.
- util file which contains the robot kinematics description.
- forward and inverse and jacobian function files.
- draw_myrobot file which draws the robot links and joints.
- also each task is written in separate m file for easier access to them.
